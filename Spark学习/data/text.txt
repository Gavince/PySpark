Prior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-
folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of
these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as
 a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross
-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see for
 tools, documentation, and open-source code examples.
